### Changed

#### Complete Code Refactoring
- 🔄 **Modular Architecture** - Split monolithic 1,441-line `index.html` into 7 clean modules:
  - `js/constants.js` (143 lines) - Configuration management
  - `js/lighting.js` (105 lines) - Lighting system
  - `js/models.js` (178 lines) - Model loading and management
  - `js/animation.js` (137 lines) - Animation control
  - `js/ascii.js` (184 lines) - ASCII effect management
  - `js/ui.js` (501 lines) - UI event handling
  - `js/app.js` (264 lines) - Main application coordinator

- 🔄 **index.html** reduced from 1,441 lines to 195 lines (86% reduction)
  - Removed all inline JavaScript (1,200+ lines)
  - Kept clean semantic HTML structure
  - Added comprehensive ARIA attributes
  - Single `<script type="module" src="./js/app.js"></script>` tag

#### Code Quality Improvements
- ✅ **Zero console.log statements** - Removed all 63 debug console.logs
- ✅ **Removed commented code** - Cleaned up 100+ lines of commented/dead code
- ✅ **JSDoc everywhere** - Every function has comprehensive documentation
- ✅ **No magic numbers** - All values extracted to named constants in `CONFIG`
- ✅ **Proper error handling** - Try-catch blocks with meaningful error messages
- ✅ **ES6 best practices** - const/let (no var), arrow functions, template literals, destructuring

#### Architecture Improvements
- ✅ **Single Responsibility Principle** - Each module has one clear purpose
- ✅ **Dependency Injection** - Managers receive dependencies via constructors
- ✅ **Facade Pattern** - App class provides simplified API to complex subsystems
- ✅ **Manager Pattern** - Clear separation of concerns across systems
- ✅ **No global pollution** - All code encapsulated in modules and classes

#### Performance & Memory Management
- ✅ Proper resource disposal in `ModelManager.disposeCurrentModel()`
- ✅ Animation cleanup in `AnimationManager.dispose()`
- ✅ Memory leak prevention through proper WebGL resource cleanup

### Removed
- ❌ **63 console.log statements** (production hygiene)
- ❌ **100+ lines of commented code** (dead code removal)
- ❌ **Inline event handlers** (onclick attributes removed)
- ❌ **Global variables** (encapsulated in classes)
- ❌ **Magic numbers** (moved to constants)

### Technical Details

#### Lines of Code Reduction
- **Before:** 1,441 lines in index.html
- **After:** 195 lines HTML + ~1,512 lines across 7 clean modules
- **Net Result:** Same functionality, dramatically better organization

#### Test Coverage
- 25 unit tests across 3 test suites
- Tests for constants validation, lighting system, and animation system
- Mock implementations for external dependencies
- Automated coverage reporting in CI/CD

#### Code Quality Metrics
- **ESLint:** 0 warnings, 0 errors
- **Prettier:** 100% formatted
- **JSDoc Coverage:** 100% of public methods
- **Test Coverage:** 70%+ across all metrics

### Maintained (No Breaking Changes)
- ✅ All existing features work identically
- ✅ Same user interface and controls
- ✅ Same performance characteristics
- ✅ Same offline capability
- ✅ Same model support (duck, rat, doge, alien)
- ✅ Same lighting presets
- ✅ Same custom character functionality
- ✅ Same export features (copy/download)
- ✅ Fully backward compatible

### Developer Experience Improvements
- 🚀 **Faster development** - Modular code is easier to navigate
- 🧪 **Testable** - Each module can be tested in isolation
- 📝 **Self-documenting** - JSDoc provides inline API documentation
- 🔍 **Debuggable** - Clear module boundaries make debugging easier
- 🤝 **Collaborative** - Multiple developers can work on different modules
- 📈 **Scalable** - Easy to add new features without breaking existing code
